Bayesian Networks allow us to integrate expert knowledge and data from multiple heterogeneous sources; thus they allow us to model the heterogeneity of human behaviour  and update our knowledge (or our belief) on each variable.   As  a  result  they  are  able  to  capture  the  effect  of  the complex human behaviour - social physics - and the behaviour of societies in ways that cannot be achieved using classical statistical methods. Bayesian models also  enable  us  to  update  our  knowledge  on  each  variable as we gather more evidence.  This means we can update models in real-time as we learn more about each variable in the system; **using machine-learning techniques we can generate Bayesian Networks to automatically estimate all parameters in the system**.
